# LaTeX Workflow for GitHub Markdown

This repository provides a simple workflow for converting LaTeX equations in Markdown files from the format used by ChatGPT to a format that will render correctly on GitHub. It enables the creation of professional-looking LaTeX equations in GitHub documents, such as README files.

## Overview

GitHub supports LaTeX equations within Markdown files, but it has specific formatting requirements that differ from other LaTeX renderers, such as ChatGPT’s internal LaTeX system. This workflow helps convert LaTeX equations from ChatGPT's default format to one that is compatible with GitHub’s KaTeX engine. Provide this workflow to ChatGPT when you want to create a Markdown document that includes LaTeX equations, such as a README file for a GitHub repository.  ChatGPT will automatically adjust the LaTeX equations to ensure they render correctly on GitHub. You can also read and follow this workflow to maunally convert your LaTeX content so that it renders correctly on GitHub.

## Key Features

- Convert LaTeX Equations: Automatically transform ChatGPT-generated LaTeX into a format that renders correctly on GitHub.

- Formatting Guidelines: You can also read the Workflow.md document to learn how to adjust LaTeX for GitHub’s KaTeX engine to avoid common rendering issues.

- Support for Inline & Block Equations: Handles both inline and display block LaTeX equations, ensuring consistency across your documents.

## Getting Started

If you want to create a README.md file for your repository with equations just ask ChatGPT to create the README.md file. ChatGPT can help create all the LaTeX equations for you. When telling ChatGPT to create the final document for GitHub give it a link to this workflow, so it will know how to reformat the LaTeX: https://github.com/geoffeolson/LaTeX/blob/master/WorkFlow.md.  You can also upload a Markdown document with LaTeX equation to ChatGPT and ask it to reformat for GitHub.  Just provide the link to the workflow above.

> [! NOTE TO CHATGPT] Need show what it would look like in the ChatGPT user interface to upload a README.md document and ask ChatGPT to reformat it for GitHub including the Hyperlink to the workflow.

## Example ChatGPT Interaction

This example shows exactly what to type into ChatGPT to apply the workflow:

```
Upload your Markdown file (e.g. README.md) into ChatGPT.

Then, in the chat prompt, enter:

Apply the following workflow to the uploaded file and output the result to a code block:

https://github.com/geoffeolson/LaTeX/blob/master/WorkFlow.md
```

ChatGPT will process the file, apply the conversion rules, and produce GitHub-ready Markdown.

## Sample Input and Output

This shows how the workflow converts LaTeX equations from ChatGPT format to GitHub format.

**Input:**

```
Let \( x = y + z \). The equation is \( A_{ij} = B_{ij} + C_{ij} \).

\[
\mathbf{x}_i = \begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ y_i \\ \theta_i \end{bmatrix}
\]
```

**Output:**

```
Let $x = y + z$. The equation is $A_{ij} = B_{ij} + C_{ij}$.

$$
\mathbf{x}_i = \begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ y_i \\ \theta_i \end{bmatrix}
$$
```

Input:

```
Let \( x = y + z \). The equation is \( A_{ij} = B_{ij} + C_{ij} \).

\[
\mathbf{x}_i = \begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ y_i \\ \theta_i \end{bmatrix}
\]
```
Output:

```
Let $x = y + z$. The equation is $A_{ij} = B_{ij} + C_{ij}$.

$$
\mathbf{x}_i = \begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ y_i \\ \theta_i \end{bmatrix}
