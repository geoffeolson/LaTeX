# LaTeX Workflow for GitHub Markdown

This repository provides a simple workflow for converting LaTeX equations in Markdown files from the format used by ChatGPT to a format that will render correctly on GitHub. It enables the creation of professional-looking LaTeX equations in GitHub documents, such as README files.

## Overview

GitHub supports LaTeX equations within Markdown files, but it has specific formatting requirements that differ from other LaTeX renderers, such as ChatGPT’s internal LaTeX system. This workflow helps convert LaTeX equations from ChatGPT's default format to one that is compatible with GitHub’s KaTeX engine.

By following this workflow, you can easily convert your LaTeX content, whether it’s inline or block equations, ensuring that everything renders properly on GitHub.

## Key Features

- Convert LaTeX Equations: Automatically transform ChatGPT-generated LaTeX into a format that renders correctly on GitHub.

- Support for Inline & Block Equations: Handle both inline and display block LaTeX equations, ensuring consistency across your documents.

- Formatting Guidelines: Learn how to adjust LaTeX for GitHub’s KaTeX engine to avoid common rendering issues.

## Getting Started
To use this workflow just upload the Markdown document with LaTeX equations you want to render in GitHub. In the uplaod message include the following link to the Workflow: https://github.com/geoffeolson/LaTeX/blob/master/WorkFlow.md.

Note: Need show what this looks like in ChatGPT.


## Sample Input and Output
Input:

```
Let \( x = y + z \). The equation is \( A_{ij} = B_{ij} + C_{ij} \).

\[
\mathbf{x}_i = \begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ y_i \\ \theta_i \end{bmatrix}
\]
```
Output:

```
Let $x = y + z$. The equation is $A_{ij} = B_{ij} + C_{ij}$.

$$
\mathbf{x}_i = \begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ y_i \\ \theta_i \end{bmatrix}
$$
```
